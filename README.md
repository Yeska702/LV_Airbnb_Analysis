## ASK
As a local resident of Las Vegas, I have a few questions regarding tourism and accommodation trend in the city:

1. Which months are considered the buisest for vistors thoughout the year?
2. During which months is tourism typically slower, offering the best opportunties for cost savings?
3. To what extent does the pricing of individual neighborhoods influence Airbnb rates across the city?

While the line graphs in PDF provided some insight inot how average prices vary significantly across different neighborhoods, it also highlighted that the Unincorporated Area have the highest average prices. Given the complexity of creating a detailed map of Clark County in RStudio. I opted to use Tableau instead. The resulting map revealed that the Unincorporated Areas encompass a large portion of Clark County that was not fully captured in the initial dataset. As a local resident, I recognize that these Unincorporated Areas actully consist of several distinct neighborhoods, including Enterprise, Spring Valley, Paradise, Winchester, and Whitney.
