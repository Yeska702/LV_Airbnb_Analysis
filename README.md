## ASK
As a local resident of Las Vegas, I have a few questions regarding tourism and accommodation trend in the city:

1. Which months are considered the buisest for vistors thoughout the year?
2. During which months is tourism typically slower, offering the best opportunties for cost savings?
3. To what extent does the pricing of individual neighborhoods influence Airbnb rates across the city?
